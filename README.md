# WSAOnWin10
### This Repository is base on [MagiskOnWSA](https://github.com/LSPosed/MagiskOnWSALocal) and [WSAPatch](https://github.com/cinit/WSAPatch), uses Gihub Actions to automatically integrate Magisk root and Google Apps into WSA and make it run on Windows 10
### This project only ensures stable running on Windows 10 (also can work on Windows 11 in theory), if you are using Windows 11, it's better to visit [WSA-Script](https://github.com/YT-Advanced/WSA-Script)
